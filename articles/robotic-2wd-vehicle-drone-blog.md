# How to Make a Robotic 2WD Vehicle Drone for Air + Land Surveillance

Building a hybrid surveillance system that combines ground and aerial capabilities opens up incredible possibilities for monitoring, security, and exploration projects. In this guide, we'll walk through creating a 2WD robotic vehicle integrated with a drone for comprehensive air and land surveillance.

## Project Overview

This project combines two robotic platforms:

## Components Required

### For the 2WD Ground Vehicle:

- 3S or 4S LiPo Battery (2200-5000mAh)
- Radio Transmitter and Receiver (6+ channels)
- GPS Module
- FPV Camera
- Video Transmitter (VTX) and Antenna

**Additional Components:**
- Power Distribution Board (PDB)

- Landing Gear

### Shared Components:

- 5.8GHz FPV System (Video Transmitter and Receiver)
- Telemetry Modules (for long-range control)
- Central Control Station (Laptop/Ground Station Software)
- Charging equipment for batteries

## Building the 2WD Ground Vehicle

### Step 1: Assemble the Chassis

Start by constructing the base of your ground vehicle. Attach the DC motors to the chassis using motor brackets. Ensure they're securely mounted and aligned parallel to each other. Install the castor wheel at the front or rear for balance.

### Step 2: Wire the Motor Driver

Connect the L298N motor driver to your Arduino or Raspberry Pi. The motor driver will control the speed and direction of both motors. Wire the DC motors to the output terminals of the motor driver, and connect the control pins to your microcontroller's digital pins.

**Basic Wiring:**
- Motor Driver IN1, IN2, IN3, IN4 → Arduino Digital Pins (e.g., 8, 9, 10, 11)
- Motor Driver ENA, ENB → Arduino PWM Pins (e.g., 5, 6)
- Motor Driver 12V → Battery positive
- Motor Driver GND → Common ground

### Step 3: Install Sensors

Mount ultrasonic sensors at the front, left, and right sides of the vehicle for obstacle detection. Wire them to the Arduino:
- VCC → 5V
- Trig → Digital Pin
- Echo → Digital Pin
- GND → Ground

Install the GPS module and connect it via UART to your controller. Mount the camera module on a servo for pan/tilt capability if desired.

### Step 4: Program the Ground Vehicle

Upload control code to your Arduino/Raspberry Pi. The program should include:
- Motor control functions (forward, backward, left, right, stop)
- Obstacle detection and avoidance
- GPS coordinate logging
- Video streaming from camera
- Wireless communication (WiFi or RF)

### Step 5: Power System

Use a voltage regulator to step down the 12V battery to 5V for the Arduino and sensors. Ensure all grounds are connected together. Add a power switch for easy on/off control.

## Building the Aerial Drone

### Step 1: Assemble the Frame

Attach the arms to the drone frame's central plate. Most F450 frames come with pre-drilled holes and are straightforward to assemble. Mount the Power Distribution Board (PDB) in the center.

### Step 2: Mount Motors and ESCs

Install brushless motors on each arm using the provided screws. Connect each motor to an ESC, and connect all ESCs to the PDB. Pay attention to motor rotation direction—two should spin clockwise and two counter-clockwise.

### Step 3: Install Flight Controller

Mount the flight controller at the center of the frame using vibration damping pads. The arrow on the flight controller should point forward. Connect the ESCs to the appropriate motor outputs on the flight controller.

### Step 4: Wire the Electronics

Connect the following to the flight controller:
- GPS module → GPS port
- Radio receiver → RC input channels
- Battery alarm → PDB
- FPV camera and VTX → PDB for power

### Step 5: Calibrate and Configure

Install ground station software (Mission Planner for Pixhawk, Betaflight for racing controllers). Calibrate:
- Accelerometer
- Compass
- Radio transmitter
- ESCs
- Flight modes

Configure fail-safe settings to ensure the drone returns to home or lands safely if signal is lost.

### Step 6: FPV System Setup

Mount the FPV camera at the front of the drone. Connect it to the video transmitter. On your ground station, set up the FPV receiver and connect it to goggles or a monitor for live video feed.

## Integration: Creating the Surveillance System

### Communication Network

Set up a unified communication system using:
- 2.4GHz radio control for the drone
- 5.8GHz for FPV video from both platforms
- WiFi or 433MHz telemetry for data transmission
- Ground station software to display feeds from both vehicles

### Coordinated Control

Develop a mission planning interface where you can:
- Set waypoints for both vehicles
- Switch between manual and autonomous modes
- View real-time location on a map
- Monitor battery levels and sensor data
- Record surveillance footage

### Software Integration

Use software like Mission Planner, QGroundControl, or create a custom interface using:
- Python for backend processing
- OpenCV for video analysis
- MAVLink protocol for drone communication
- MQTT or WebSockets for ground vehicle communication

## Operational Modes

### Mode 1: Independent Operation
Both vehicles operate separately, covering different areas. The ground vehicle navigates terrain while the drone provides aerial overview.

### Mode 2: Coordinated Surveillance
The drone scouts ahead and identifies obstacles or points of interest. It communicates this data to the ground vehicle, which investigates more closely.

### Mode 3: Autonomous Patrol
Both platforms follow pre-programmed routes, automatically recording video and GPS data. They can be programmed to respond to detected movement or anomalies.

## Safety and Testing

### Testing Protocol

1. **Ground Vehicle Testing:**
   - Test motors individually
   - Verify obstacle detection
   - Test manual control
   - Test autonomous navigation in a safe area

2. **Drone Testing:**
   - Test motors and ESCs on bench
   - Perform tethered test flights
   - Test fail-safe mechanisms
   - Gradually increase flight envelope

3. **Integration Testing:**
   - Test communication between platforms
   - Verify video feeds
   - Test coordinated movements
   - Simulate mission scenarios

### Safety Considerations

- Always fly the drone in open areas away from people
- Check battery levels before each mission
- Have a kill switch or fail-safe enabled
- Follow local regulations for drone operation
- Never exceed visual line-of-sight unless certified
- Use propeller guards during testing
- Keep spare parts available

## Enhancements and Upgrades

### Advanced Features:

1. **AI Object Detection:** Integrate TensorFlow or YOLO for automatic person/vehicle detection
2. **Night Vision:** Add IR cameras for low-light surveillance
3. **Extended Range:** Upgrade to long-range telemetry (up to 10km+)
4. **Gesture Control:** Use hand gestures to control both platforms
5. **Swarm Capability:** Add multiple drones working together
6. **Solar Charging:** Add solar panels for extended missions
7. **Payload Delivery:** Enable the ground vehicle to deploy the drone

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Ground Vehicle:**
- Motors not running: Check motor driver connections and power supply
- Erratic movement: Calibrate wheel speeds, check for loose connections
- Poor obstacle detection: Adjust sensor angles and thresholds

**Drone:**
- Won't arm: Check flight controller calibration and radio setup
- Unstable flight: Recalibrate accelerometer, check propeller balance
- GPS not locking: Ensure clear sky view, check GPS module connections
- Weak FPV signal: Check antenna orientation and VTX power level

## Conclusion

Building a hybrid air-land surveillance system is an ambitious project that combines multiple robotics disciplines. While challenging, the result is a versatile platform capable of comprehensive area monitoring. Start with basic functionality, test thoroughly, and gradually add advanced features as you gain experience.

This project teaches valuable skills in robotics, programming, electronics, and system integration. Whether you're building it for security, research, or hobby purposes, the combination of ground and aerial capabilities creates a powerful surveillance solution.

Remember to always operate responsibly, respect privacy laws, and follow local regulations regarding robotic vehicles and drones. Happy building!
